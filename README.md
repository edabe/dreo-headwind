# dreo-headwind
Trying to put together a rudimentary version of a smart fan for workout sessions (primarily cycling) leveraging the smart Dreo fan DR-HAF004S (CF714S) with its vertical and horizontal oscillating capabilities, an old Raspberry Pi and old USB ANT+ stick.

This is a good opportunity to learn a bit of TypeScript and the ANT+ protocol while creating something that fits my needs better; for instance, I would like to have the fan pointing at my bike trainer when cycling indoors, but also have it tilt and point to a rowing machine while always adjusting the air speed to my heart rate.

I hope this will get somewhere.

## Special Thanks
This project is deriived from the following projects:
- DreoAPI from the [zyonse/homebridge-dreo](https://github.com/zyonse/homebridge-dreo)
- ANT+ implementation from [incyclist/ant-plus](https://github.com/incyclist/ant-plus)
And probably bits and pieces from other sources - I'll do my best to list them all.
